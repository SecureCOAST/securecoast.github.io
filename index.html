            <h1>COAST Previews at CeBIT 2014</h1>
            <h2>Computer On A Stick promises new level of online privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Ahead of its launch in Germany, the UK and USA this May, COAST is making its first ever public appearance at CeBIT 2014 - Europe's huge technical trade fair staged in Hannover across March 10th / 14th.
            </p>
            <p>
                COAST (deriving from Computer On A Stick) is a high-quality 16GB USB2.0 memory stick pre-programmed with a suite of applications and proprietary conÔ¨Åguration tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Equipped with an easy-to-use dashboard, its 'triple-lock' protection features have been designed to provide a new level of plug-in privacy for PC users who are tired of their online lives being an open book to ISPs, hackers and surveillance agencies.
            </p>
            <h2>Commenting on the launch, Broadband Computer Company CEO, Jim Leslie, said:</h2>
            <p>
                "Online privacy is a massive and increasingly important issue. Recent media revelations confirm that indiscriminate, intrusive and sometimes illegal online surveillance is prevalent and on the increase. Whatever the motive of the watchers - be they criminals, commercial organisations or government agencies - today's computer users are extremely vulnerable. COAST has been developed with their needs in mind and we expect a very strong take-up when we start shipping units in a few weeks' time."
            </p>
            <h2>Founder and COO of the Broadband Computer Company, Andy Hudson, added:</h2>
            <p>
                "Privacy should be a right, not a privilege. But most online solutions are out of reach of the everyday PC user - either on price or their ability to manage the technologies involved. COAST bridges that gap. It's easy to use, affordable and extremely effective. And like most good ideas, it's simple. Just plug it in and a new level of privacy is yours."
